# OM CRUD app test

---------------

###Using:

 * Spring Boot
 * Spring MVC
 * Spring Core
 * JPA2.1 and Hibernate
 * Spring Security
 * Angular.js

This will be used as a base for a project and it's just a test of the stack.

Currently using bower and Maven.

###To run:

mvn spring-boot:run

###TODO:

* ~~Create folder structure~~
* ~~Create pom.xml~~
* ~~Make Spring boot work~~
* ~~Add Bower and Angular~~
* Create simple Angular site
* Add a development profile
* Add a in memory(h2) development database
* Integrate bower as part of maven build process

Cheers
